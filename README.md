## ‚è± Page Load Time

The Webapp loads in about 0.4 s to 0.6s. This is calculated by using Google Lighthouse tool in Chromium based browsers. 
*NOTE: The Lighthouse Audits scores are decreased because of preinstalled browser extensions that are non-removable in my system.*

## ü™ú Steps I took to optimize the page load time

- Used `.webp` assets instead of `.png` or `.jpeg` to minmizing loading time.
- Used SVG icons wherever possible as they are lighter than image type icons.
- Used PurgeCSS to tree-shake unused styles and optimize my final build size.
- Used Lighthouse DevTools Extension to find the performance issues and fix them using their actionable suggestion.
- Used netlify that has world-class CDN technology that reduces waiting time even further.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
